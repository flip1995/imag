## Diary {#sec:modules:diary}

The diary module is for keeping your diary notes.

The diary module giv3s you the possibility to write your diary in imag.
It offers daily, hourly and minutely entries (the latter beeing more like
a private tumble-blog).

Exporting the diary is possible, so one can write it in markdown and
later pass that to pandoc, if desired, to generate a website or book
from it.
