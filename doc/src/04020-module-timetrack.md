## Timetrack {#sec:modules:timetrack}

The Timetrack module implements a `timewarrior`-like timetracking functionality
for imag.

Each timetracking is a 'tag' which can be started and stopped. These tags are
_no_ tags as in imag-tag, but timetracking-tags.

Summaries can be printed, also filtered by tags if desired.
